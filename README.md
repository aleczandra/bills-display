# bills-display
This project is supposed to create a simple UI interface that would read bills from elastic and display them. 

Iteration #1 - Just read the bills and display them.
Iteration #2 - Search and filtering functionality.
Iteration #3 - Show all or show only bills corresponding to a certain user.


How to start the entire application

Projects involved:
1. bills-generator (aka producer)
2. bills-processer (aka consumer)
3. bills-display (aka kind of interface)


The folder under the bills-display contains the docker scripts.

docker/bills/bills-display 
   - contains the scripts to generate a docker image from the bills-display application; the application will be started on port 8080
   - docker build -t billdisplay .

docker/bills/bills-processer 
   - contains the scripts to generate the docker image for the consumer, from the bills-processer application
   - first we generate locally a .jar file
   - we override into the container the application.yml with some other settings (eventuallly)
   - the processer will be started and will listen till there is something into the queue
   - the processer will read from the queue and will save it into elasticsearch
   - we have to have saved into the application the hostname for the elasticsearch: right now (06.10.2017) it is still hardcoded, but  should 
   be eventually configured into application.yml und read inside the application
   - hostname: elastic, user:elastic, password: changeme
   - docker build -t processer .
   
docker/bills/elasticsearch
   - contains already the docker-compose yml to start the elasticsearch (not used here, moved into processer-display/docker-compose.yml))
   
docker/bills/kafka
   - contains already the docker-compose.yml to start the zookeeper + kafka  (not used here, moved into processer-display/docker-compose.yml)
   
docker/bills/processer-display
   - contains the docker-compose.yml file to start all the services: kafka, zookeeper, elastic, processer, display
   - the services got a hostname so we can use this property when we want to specify that a service has to connect to another one (eg. processer connects to elastic)
   - KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: 172.17.0.1 - this is very important!!!! the IP represents the docker network IP
            - more info here: https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker/issues/17
            


So the setup till now is more or less flexible. Still have to work on it, but for the first try at least it works: starts the services, reads the things from 
kafka and saves them in elasticsearch.

To start everything just have to run:
/docker/bills/processer-display/docker-compose up    

Then in order to write into kafka, run separately the bills-generator project

Then access everything at: http://localhost:8080/index/bills



--------------------------------------------------------MAC problem----------------------------------------------------------

On MAC the producer and the consumer containers could not process information from the kafka queue, because they could not connect to the broadcast server. Didn't know exactly which IP has to be specified as the broadcast server.

This post https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker/issues/169 has the solution. The solution from hung-phan worked out for me. 

export DOCKER_KAFKA_HOST=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0)
....
kafka:
    image: wurstmeister/kafka
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: ${DOCKER_KAFKA_HOST}
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
....
